# KaiNotes README

KaiNotes provides a simple way to organize your markdown notes. When you add tags in your markdown files, you can easily find them in the sidebar. The files that contain the tag are displayed below. 

Tags are written like this: `#javascript #front-end #react`, starts with a hash symbol. You can add tag anywhere in your file. If you have used BearNotes before, you will find this function is similar.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Following extension guidelines

Ensure that you've read through the extensions guidelines and follow the best practices for creating your extension.
